decimal-to-binary
=================

Convert decimal numbers (unsigned integers) to their corresponding binary representation.

Execute in the command line with a single argument of the unsigned integer you wish
to conver from decimal representation to binary representation.

This program is used as an extension (some internal functionality) for a WIP project by 
Eric Falkenberg, Kamil Bynoe, and Chris Sprague.
