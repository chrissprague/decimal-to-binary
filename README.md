decimal-to-binary
=================

Convert decimal numbers (unsigned integers) to their corresponding binary representation.

Execute in the command line with a single argument of the unsigned integer you wish
to convert from decimal representation to binary representation.

This program is used as an extension (some internal functionality) for a WIP project by 
Eric Falkenberg, Kamil Bynoe, and Chris Sprague.

Inspiration: being able to write the algorithm to convert decimal to binary on the board 
through brainstorming, for the WIP app. Design was in Python (so basically English).
The shell script was created in order to allow me to analyze patterns in binary
representations of numbers divisible by 3 (question involved creating a DFA to prove
the above representations are elements of a regular language.)
